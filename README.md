# Fake News Detection using Decision Tree Classifier

This project involves detecting fake news using a decision tree classifier in Jupyter Notebook. Fake news detection is an important task in the field of natural language processing and machine learning, as it helps identify and filter out misleading or false information. Through this project, we aim to explore and understand how a decision tree classifier can be used for fake news detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled news articles. The dataset should be in a CSV (Comma Separated Values) format with two columns: "Text" and "Label". Each row represents a news article with the corresponding text content and label indicating whether it is fake or real news. Make sure to preprocess and clean the dataset before using it for modeling.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaadclt/Fake-News-Detection-DecisionTreeClassifier.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd Fake-News-Detection-DecisionTreeClassifier
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

4. Place your preprocessed dataset in the project directory.

5. Run Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

6. Open the `Fake News Detection.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

7. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the decision tree classifier, and make predictions.

## Project Overview

The notebook provides an overview of the steps involved in fake news detection using a decision tree classifier. The steps include:

1. Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the text data for analysis.
3. Feature Extraction: Converting the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.
4. Decision Tree Classifier: Training the decision tree classifier on the preprocessed dataset.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.
6. Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new news articles.

The notebook includes explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to aid in understanding the fake news detection process using a decision tree classifier.

## Results and Insights

The project aims to detect fake news using a decision tree classifier. The results and insights gained from this project include:

- Evaluating the performance of the decision tree classifier in terms of accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
- Understanding the important features or words that contribute to distinguishing between fake and real news.
- Applying the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen news articles.

The insights gained from this project can help in automatically identifying and flagging potentially fake news articles.

## Customization

You can customize the project by modifying the dataset, trying different preprocessing techniques, experimenting with different feature extraction methods, or exploring other machine learning algorithms for fake news detection. This project serves as a starting point for fake news detection using a decision tree classifier, and you can extend it further to suit your needs.
